Modularbank test assigment.

Build with:

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
Some parts of Bulma framework, React hook form, React select. 

To run install npm packages, than as every react create app:

npm start - for development mode
npm run build - for build, than serve with: serve -s build -l 4000


To make boundle smaller we use only what we need - import only part of bulma etc.
